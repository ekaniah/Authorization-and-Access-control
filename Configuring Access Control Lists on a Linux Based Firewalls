# Lab Title: Authorization and Access control

## Date: 05/21/2024

## Lab Overview:
Provide a brief overview of the lab, including the lab title and the purpose, in one or two sentences
This lab teaches one how to set up a Linux-based firewall and configure access control lists (ACLs) to control traffic as well as test those rules.
I also learnt what a Network Address Translation (NAT) is, how it works, and how to set one up.

### Part 1 - Configuring Access Control Lists on a Linux Based Firewalls

#### Time for Lab Completion:
Provide the time to complete the lab in “HRS, MIN” format,
2hrs,5mins

#### Purpose of the Lab:
Provide a detailed description of the lab, including what the main idea was, the tasks performed, how it relates to the unit, and how it relates to cybersecurity as a whole
This lab teaches one how to set up a sniffer, enable services, and configure Linux Firewall rules and test those rules.
Configuring access control list on a linux based firewall is an important security measure that helps control and restrict network traffic to and from a system or network.

### Part 2 - Implementing Nat and allowing remote access

#### Time for Lab Completion:

Provide the time to complete the lab in “HRS, MIN” format
1hr,45mins

#### Purpose of the Lab:
Provide a detailed description of the lab, including what the main idea was, the tasks performed, how it relates to the unit, and how it relates to cybersecurity as a whole
This lab teaches one how to configure a Network Address Translation-NAT, use Wireshark to understand how NAT works and use remote desktop on a network.
Network Address Translation-NAT allows many machines with private IP addresses to use a single Public IP Address to connect to the Internet. In this lab, you will implement NAT on a firewall.

#### What did you enjoy about the lab?
Your description here
I always enjoy the interactiveness of the lab.
#### What did you find most challenging about the lab?
Your description here
I didn't find any of the task challenging. It was easy to understand and straightfoward.

pfsense
What do you setup when you want to filter traffic from getting through a firewall?
NAT firewall rule

Discussion Questions C
What is a VPN?
